The visualizations above just touch the surface of what is available from hvPlot, and you can explore the [hvPlot website](https://hvplot.pyviz.org) to see much more, or just explore it yourself using tab completion (`df.hvplot.`_[TAB]_). The following section will focus on how to put these plots together once you have them, linking them to understand and show their structure."
