    "- All interactivity works the same in Jupyter and in a standalone deployment.\n",
    "- High-level (quick and convenient) interfaces are [shortcuts, not dead ends](https://holoviz.org/tutorial/Overview.html), so you don't get stuck.\n",

    "With the above design goals in mind, we have developed a set of independent but complementary open-source Python packages to streamline the process of working with small and large datasets (from a few datapoints to billions or more) in a web browser, whether doing exploratory analysis, making simple widget-based tools, or building full-featured dashboards. The main libraries in this ecosystem include:\n",

    "-   [HoloViews](http://holoviews.org): Declarative objects for instantly visualizable data, building Bokeh plots from convenient high-level specifications\n",
    "-   [GeoViews](http://geoviews.org): Visualizable geographic data that that can be mixed and matched with HoloViews objects\n",
    "-   [Datashader](http://datashader.org): Rasterizing huge datasets quickly as fixed-size arrays or images\n",
    "-   [Param](http://param.pyviz.org): Declaring user-relevant parameters, making it simple to work with widgets inside and outside of a notebook context\n",

    "# Python Dashboarding landscape \n",
    "\n",
    "According to [PyViz.org](pyviz.org), there are 11 libraries for creating live Python-backed web applications or dashboards that a user can interact with — bokeh, dash, streamlit, panel, gradio, visdom, voila, wave, jupyter-flex, ipyflex, and bloxs. The most popular dashboard-focused tools are Plotly Dash, Panel, Voila, and Streamlit. The most popular dashboard-focused tools are [Plotly Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/), [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/), [Voila](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).\n",
    "![](assets/dashboard_tools.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are the differences among these, and which tool should you use?\n",
    "To help users decide, James Bednar (representing PyViz but also a Panel maintainer) hosted a PyData Global workshop where representatives for each of these tools could discuss and debate their similarities and differences. Contributing were Marc Skov Madsen (user and Panel developer, creator of awesome-panel.org and awesome-streamlit.org), Adrien Treuille (co-founder and CEO of Streamlit), Nicolas Kruchten (creator of Plotly Express and Dash developer), and Sylvain Corlay (creator of Voila and Jupyter core developer).\n",
    "\n",
    "The detailed comparison of the PyData talk discussion is summarized in the table below. From what I have learned from the talk and from my experience, here are the biggest differentiating factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Does the tool support your favorite plotting library?\n",
    "What are your favorite plotting libraries? Do you like to use Matplotlib, Bokeh, Plotly, Hvplot, or others?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dash is primarily tied to Plotly. If you are a Plotly user, Dash is your natural choice.\n",
    "- Voila supports various libraries with an ipywidgets interface, such as Matplotlib and Plotly. For libraries that are not Jupyter widgets such as Bokeh, Voila does not work well.\n",
    "- Streamlit and Panel support many plotting libraries, including Matplotlib, Seaborn, Altair, Plotly, Bokeh, PyDeck, GraphViz and more.\n",
    "- Furthermore, if you have a need for interactivity in a plot such as creating interlinked plots, Panel provides rich support for advanced interactivity features, while Streamlit does not allow for interactivity with a plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Do you use Jupyter Notebooks?\n",
    "As a data scientist, my workflow usually starts with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. It’s essential for me to be able to interact with my plot and build my dashboard directly in and from the Jupyter Notebooks. Panel and Voila work well with data science Jupyter Notebook workflow, while Dash and Streamlit do not. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Panel and Voila fully support using components from a Jupyter notebook in a dashboard to make it easy to switch between data exploration and sharing the results.\n",
    "- Dash does not integrate smoothly with Jupyter. JupyterDash does enable you to code and display Dash apps in notebooks, but requires additional configuration and not in the same elegant way you’d get from Panel/Voila.\n",
    "- Streamlit does not integrate smoothly with Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Will you ever need to build complex apps or use big data?\n",
    "Sometimes, we need to build complex visualization apps. For example, we might want our app to support multiple pages with each page showing different features and insights. Only Panel and Dash have good solid support for multi-page apps. Streamlit just released multipage app support a week ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "For visualizing big data, the Python visualization world often uses Datashader. Check out my previous blog post on what is Datashader and how Datashader works. Panel and Datashader both come from the Holoviz ecosystem and are designed to work well together. In addition to Panel, Dash and Voila also support Datashader for server-side rendering of big data, but Streamlit does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How many simultaneous users do you need to support?\n",
    "We often need to send our dashboards to many stakeholders and it’d be nice if our dashboards can scale well and support many simultaneous users. Dash scales well; Voila is the worst; Steamlit and Panel are in the middle. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dash is stateless, not storing data on the server per visitor, which makes it simple to support many users but much more difficult to program.\n",
    "- Voila requires a full Python process per visitor to the dashboard, limiting it to a few visitors at once.\n",
    "Streamlit and Panel are in the middle, supporting per-visitor state by default but also allowing caching and sharing state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Do you want to share your apps with the public?\n",
    "If you have the need to share your dashboarding apps with the public, Steamlit is the easiest. Streamlit offers easy deployment using Streamlit Cloud, and perhaps as a result it has the best community demos and contributions. The other tools can all be shared using standard cloud providers, but they need to be configured separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### To highlight the key points discussed above:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does the tool support your favorite plotting library? Streamlit and Panel support many plotting libraries. Panel provides rich support for advanced interactivity features.\n",
    "- Do you use Jupyter Notebooks? If yes, then choose Panel or Voila.\n",
    "- Will you ever need to build complex apps or use big data? If yes, then choose Panel or Dash.\n",
    "- How many simultaneous users do you need to support? If your dashboards need to be highly scalable, use Dash.\n",
    "- Do you want to share your apps with the public? For easy deployment, use Streamlit.\n",
